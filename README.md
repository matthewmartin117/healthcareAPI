Healthcare API

A simple RESTful API for managing patients, clinical notes, and biological samples. Built using Spring Boot, this project demonstrates CRUD operations and nested resource management for healthcare-related data.

Features

Patient Management: Create, read, update, and delete patient records.

Clinical Notes: Create, read, update, and delete notes for individual patients.

Biological Samples: Create, read, update, and delete biological samples for individual patients.

In-memory Storage: Stores all data in memory using HashMaps for demonstration purposes.

RESTful API: Fully exposes all CRUD operations via HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Technologies

Java 17+

Spring Boot 3+

Maven for dependency management

Postman / curl for testing API endpoints

Getting Started
Prerequisites

JDK 17 or higher

Maven

IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-api.git
cd healthcare-api


Build and run the application:

Data Models
Patient

patientID (String)

name (String)

dateOfBirth (Date or LocalDate)

contactInformation (Map<String, String>)

clinicalNotes (List<ClinicalNote>)

biologicalSamples (List<BiologicalSample>)

ClinicalNote

id (String)

patientID (String)

description (String)

Testing

You can test the API using Postman or curl:

# Create a patient
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/patients \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "patientID": "p001",
  "name": "Alice",
  "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
  "contactInformation": {"phone": "555-1234", "email": "alice@example.com"}
}'


All other CRUD operations follow the endpoints described above. Make sure your Spring Boot server is running on localhost:8080.

Notes

Currently uses in-memory storage, so all data will be lost when the server restarts.

IDs for notes and samples must be unique within each patient.
